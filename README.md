# CPSC-Senior-Thesis

Hello! This is my GitHub repository for my Computer Science Senior Thesis.

This project is titled: Artistic Responses on an Interactive Display.
For the first semester working on this, I was advised by Holly Rushmeier at Yale University.

Within this repository you will find the source code I worked on for this project. However, within this README you will be able to access
the links to The Plan (my notes for where I want to take this project), The List (what I think could be interesting (and possible) to implement,
and a video link to the simple structural program I've completed by the end of this first semester.
